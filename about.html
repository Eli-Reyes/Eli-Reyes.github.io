                    <p class="text">Hi, I'm Eli Reyes, <span class="bold">UX/UI designer</span>.
                    <p class="text">I graduated in <span class="bold">Market Research and Techniques</span>, which gave me the opportunity to work in banking when I arrived in Madrid, going through different departments for 15 years.</p>
                    <p class="text"> <span class="bold">What has this work experience given me?</span> a lot, from learning to communicate with other departments, to being analytical, organized, autonomous, but at the same time flexible and with the ability to make decisions and work as a team. Being close to clients has taught me to know what “active listening” is and to empathize with them, giving them the most optimal solution based on their problems and needs.</p>
                    <p class="text">But my passions have always been to discover, create and help. </p>
                    <p class="text">My artistic interests and passions have always made me in contact with workshops, courses and art schools, changing my direction towards design. Going through Arte 10, where I specialized as an <span class="bold">Architecture Model Maker</span>, landing at <span class="bold">Ironhack</span> to expand my professional career by taking the <span class="bold">UX/UI Design Bootcamp </span> and fulfilling one of my dreams <span class="bold">“to merge my professional training with my passion for design and research ” </span>.</p>
                    <p class="text">Proactive, curious, open to new challenges and wanting to continue learning and getting involved in everything I do.</p>
